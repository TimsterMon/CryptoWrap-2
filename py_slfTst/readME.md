Wrote a simple c function to do an addiition algorithm to test with the python wrapper utilizing c-types.  

Was able to get the wrapper to compile without error, but gave scewed results.  

Python is not built on a c-engine like node.js, I am not sure that is why I ran into a wall with the Python.
