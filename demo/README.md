1st incarnation = simple server that serves a simple form that accepts two inputs, combines them together
and outputs an encrypted string (in hex)

Will build upon this to look nicer, have a decryption part and demo will be done

To run, must have node installed as well as the required crypto libraries, simply run by entering 'node server.js' from the command
line within the correct directory (if no PATH or shortcuts made).  Once the server is up (will see an positive message on the command
line), either access with 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000 in a browser.  This incarnation will only run once and output.

Note: thought this would be super simple and it actually took me about two days to get this working... lol.
